# Raid Invites
Author: Skrimble-Grobbulus
Version: 0.1
I built this addon to assist with my own raid invites as raid leader in World of Warcraft.
Currently has no db functionality - planned for version 1.0

This addon assists with raid invites and offers the following functionality:
  -Multiple invite keywords
  -Minimum rank filter
  -Minimum level filter
  -Settable reset time for the minimum rank filter
  
To install this addon place the entire RaidInvites directory in your interface/addons folder
